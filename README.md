You answer the questions with four offered answers, from which you choose only one answer. Each answer to the question as well as the question itself will be saved in a file named igrac.txt. You also have two types of help at your disposal, namely: half-half help and question replacement. Half-half help works by removing two answers that are incorrect, leaving one correct answer and one randomly chosen answer. Question replacement is when you want to replace a question that you are not sure about and do not want to answer. It's all in Serbian!
